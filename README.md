Integrand is a mathematical education software designed to help students practice skills in mathematics

Background:
Mathematics is a field which can only be well-understood through practice. Many students do not get this practice because they are not motivated to do homework problems from a textbook. Integrand provides a competitive platform for students to practice their skills. Students can compete against their friends and work to achieve the highest score.

To include:
- a community database of problem sets
- compatibility for custom problem sets
- user account system
- ranking system with customizable levels of privacy (for example, only display top 3 scores or do not use real name).

A working example of the UI is shown below:
